# Activity (React) TODO_LIST

This Todolist activity built with React is a web application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks that need to be done. The project typically consists of a list of tasks, a form to add new tasks, and buttons to edit or delete existing tasks.

# Instructions for running the program
To run a React Todolist project, you will need to follow these steps:

Step 1: Install Node.js and npm on your computer.

Step 2: Open your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the project directory.

Step 3: Run the command npm install to install all the necessary dependencies.

Step 4: Once the installation is complete, run the command npm start to start the development server.

Step 5: Open your web browser and navigate to the URL http://localhost:3000/ to see the application running.

# Usage
Simply follow these steps to utilize the To-Do List app.

Step 1: Add tasks
To add a task, click or tap on the "Add Task" button or text box. Enter the details of the task, such as the task name, description, and due date, if applicable.

Step 2: Edit or delete tasks
If you need to edit or delete a task, find the task in the list and click or tap on it. Depending on the app, you may need to swipe left or right on the task to reveal options for editing or deleting it. Edit the task details as needed, or select the "Delete" option to remove the task from the list.

Step 3: Mark tasks as complete
Once you have completed a task, mark it as complete by clicking or tapping on the checkbox or circle next to the task name. Some apps may automatically move completed tasks to a separate list or archive them.
